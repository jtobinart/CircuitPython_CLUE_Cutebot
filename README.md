This is a higher-level library to allow Adafruit's [CLUE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500) and ElecFreak's micro:bit Smart [Cutebot](https://www.elecfreaks.com/micro-bit-smart-cutebot.html) to communicate while maintaining all the functionality of the CLUE, except for touch features. In version 2, the code has been updated for efficiency purposes and educational focus has shifted towards examples and wiki.

## Dependencies
This library depends on:
* [Adafruit CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) v.7.x
* [Adafruit_hcsr04](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HCSR04)

The IR remote example also depends on:
* [Adafruit_irremote](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_IRRemote)

The Adafruit BlueFruit Connect App's Controller example also depends on:
* [Adafruit_ble](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE)
* [Adafruit_bluefruit_connect](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BluefruitConnect)

## Instalations
Follow Adafruit's [CLUE Overview](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue) instructions under _CircuitPython on CLUE_. During the installation process, you will download the latest _library bundle_ and transfer several libraries to the CLUE. Transfer the dependencies listed above to your _lib folder_.
Download this repository and copy _jisforjt_cutebot_clue.mpy_ onto your CIRCUITPY drive. The _.mpy_ version of the files uses a fraction of the memory and is the recommended version.

## Usage
You can create a new main.py file and use:
```python
from jisforjt_cutebot_clue import cutebot
```
to access the Cutebot or you can use one of the example programs provided in the repository. Use the IR remote example to easily learn about IR signals and control your Cutebot in a snap. Download Adafruit's BlueFruit Connect app and control your Cutbot over Bluetooth. These examples and more are located in the _examples_ folder.
